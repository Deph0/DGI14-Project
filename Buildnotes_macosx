to build with Mac OSX, you'll need Xcode which downloads the frameworks nessery for you, including OpenGL and OpenAL.


To build, you will need to build and install these "plugins":
-glew
http://glew.sourceforge.net/install.html (make, make install)

-freealut, because Apple decided Alut isnt a part of OpenAL anymore.
https://github.com/vancegroup/freealut (make, make install)

-SoilLib (Simple OpenGL Image Library)
